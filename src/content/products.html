                The Linux microPlatform  and Zephyr RTOS  products enable you to rapidly develop and maintain secure, OTA updatable connected devices.
                Foundries.io offers a per-product (not per-unit) subscription service to the latest microPlatform updates to enable you to maintain your product with the latest security fixes, updates and new functionality throughout its lifetime, and there is no lock-in.
                Included with all Foundries.io subscriptions is demonstration access to our OTA server, which can be used to automatically deliver updates to our supported platforms.

                               In the Linux microPlatform, we provide you a recent stable kernel tested on many SoCs, and a minimal
                               runtime environment you can use to deploy applications and services in Docker containers. Both source
                               code and binary builds are provided.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                               The Linux microPlatform's minimal design is resource efficient, and follows best practices to increase
                               security through reducing attack surfaces. The container-based application environment means you are
                               free to use whatever distribution image, packaging system, libraries, or other software you choose. A
                               typical headless product implementation with networking stack and supporting Docker containers will
                               use less than 200MB of storage.
                           </p>

                               Foundries.io delivers reference Docker containers as part of the Linux microPlatform. These implement
                               support for common device needs such as IP connectivity to Bluetooth devices, CoAP and LwM2M, MQTT,
                               network proxying, and more. In our documentation, we show you how to manage these and your own
                               containers on your devices. Using these in your application, you leverage our team of open source
                               experts to reduce cost and time to market.

                                    The Zephyr Project is a scalable, cross-architecture RTOS for constrained devices, designed for
                                    security and with built-in Internet connectivity. The Foundries.io RTOS microPlatform is based
                                    on Zephyr, designed to be the future "Linux kernel of microcontrollers". Like the Linux kernel,
                                    Zephyr has an open governance model that allows companies and individuals to add features and
                                    functionality and evolve the RTOS over time. Zephyr is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.

                               critical security updates to your customers, at a fraction of the challenge and

                               Traditionally, connected device development uses long-term support infrastructure,
                               such as LTS operating system kernels, to manage and pass on updates to customers.
                               However, this does not address the entire software stack, from bootloader to
                               application. It is also slow and error-prone to back-port security and bug-fix
                               patches onto software that may be many years old.<BR>
